# PyTorch_Starter
A simple PyTorch Sample with basic functions' usage and a image classifier (training and testing with GPU)  

## **Environment**  
Windows10  
Pycharm 2018.3.4  
CUDA9.0+cuDNN9.0  
PyTorch 1.1.0

## **Notes**  
Two pretrained models with 2-epoch-training and 10-epoch-training (only 1% accuracy improvement ...).   
Anyway, use test.py to load one of them to see the result directly or train new model with chapter4.py.
